## Scope of this project

`SPECTRUM_MadMixGame` is a reverse-engineering, documentation and
preservation project — not a production service. There is no server,
no user accounts, no database, and no personal data is processed. The
repository's content falls into three categories:

- **Z80 assembly source code** (`src/*.asm`), meant to be compiled
  with `sjasmplus` and run on a ZX Spectrum 48K emulator (or a real
  Spectrum) — never on the machine that compiles it.
- **Python tools** (`tools/*.py`) that read/generate local binary
  files (`.bin`, `.tzx`, `.wav`) from other local files within the
  repository itself.
- **Self-contained HTML pages** (`recursos/*.html`) that open
  directly in the browser, with no backend and no network calls — all
  the data they display is embedded in the file itself.

Given this scope, most classic web vulnerability categories don't
apply (SQL injection, XSS with remote data, session management, etc.).
What does make sense to report:

- A `tools/` script that, when processing a deliberately crafted
  input file (a corrupted or malicious `.tzx`/`.bin`), writes outside
  the expected directory, overwrites arbitrary files, or has any other
  unsafe behavior beyond failing with a controlled error.
- Any HTML file in `recursos/` that, contrary to its current design
  (self-contained, no network), ends up loading or executing content
  from an untrusted external source.
- Any credential, token, or sensitive data that ends up in the
  repository's history by mistake.

## What is NOT a vulnerability in this project

Because of the project's own goal (a byte-for-byte reconstruction of
the original 1988 tape binary, see `README.md`/`src/README.md`), the
assembly code **deliberately** reproduces the original game's
behavior, including its historical bugs if any exist. As of today
there is no documented deliberate deviation — unlike the sister MSX
project (a *port*, not the original), which did have to fix a real
bug of its own in its v2.0 (see `manuales/manual_niveles.md` §8 of
this project for the detail of that inheritance). "Odd" behavior in
the reconstructed game that matches the original **is not a security
issue**, it's historical fidelity. If you're unsure whether something
falls into this category, report it anyway and it will be clarified.

## Supported version

There are no published releases with differentiated support: only the
`main` branch is maintained, always at its latest state.

| Branch | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | :white_check_mark: |
| any fork/older branch | :x: |

## How to report an issue

- **For most cases** (the most likely scenario: a bug in a `tools/`
  script): open a normal
  [Issue](https://github.com/raemca/SPECTRUM_MadMixGame/issues), just
  like any other bug — no need to treat it as anything special, there
  are no users at risk here.
- **If you'd really rather report it privately** (for example, if you
  found a leaked credential in the history), write to
  <raemca@hotmail.com> with the details.

This is a personal project maintained by a single person in their
spare time: there's no SLA and no bug bounty program, but every
report is reviewed and appreciated — especially from someone who took
the time to look at the code carefully.
